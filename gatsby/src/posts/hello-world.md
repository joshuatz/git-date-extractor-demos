This is a sample markdown source file, which does *not* contain date/time metadata as front-matter. However, the generated HTML / webpage *should* display the correct file creation and modification time, based on extracted git history.

In this demo, that data is injected in `gatsby-node.js`, as a node field, and is later passed around via GraphQL and extracted back out for display.
